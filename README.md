## Sorting Algorithms Visualizer
Hello there! Are you a student of algorithms? Do you find watching visuals of algorithms running oddly amusing? Or even if you're just a passerby, you'll find some fun in this project. I built this project because I was intrigued by the different types of sorting algorithms I learned while studying data structures and algorithms. I wanted to see how different sorting algorithms could be combined with elements of front-end programming to create an algorithms visualizer.

I built this application using Javascript, React, HTML, CSS, and Reactstrap. Run in Google Chrome and have some fun with sorting!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
